## Features

The project contains the following features:

- **Game Architecture**: A simple game architecture that can be used as a starting point for your own projects.
- **GUI Example**: A simple GUI example that shows how to create a basic UI using Unity's UI system.
- **Shader Graph**: A simple shader graph example that shows how to create a basic shader using Unity's Shader Graph.
- **Perlin Noise**: A simple example of how to generate Perlin noise using Unity's built-in noise functions.
- **Procedural Mesh Generation**: A simple example of how to generate a procedural mesh using Unity's built-in mesh generation functions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply clone the repository and open the project in Unity. The project is built using Unity 2022.3.18f1, so make sure you have that version of Unity installed on your machine. To visualize the examples, make sure to have the visibility of the `Gizmos` enabled in the Scene view.

When using the project, make sure to read the comments in the code to understand how each feature works. Feel free to modify and extend the project to suit your own needs.

Furthermore, make sure to use Git LFS to clone the repository, as it contains large binary files that are managed by Git LFS. To use Git LFS, you need to have Git LFS installed on your machine. You can download Git LFS from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/). While using Git with unity you should always have a different Scene for each feature you are working on, this will help you to avoid conflicts and make the project more organized.
